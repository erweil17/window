# window
This program measures the temperature inside the room and outside and tells you if you should open your window or not. Data is written to a file, which can then be read by and LCD display using the display program, or by visiting a website on the local network. It will display the current inside and outside temperatures, predicted highs and lows for the day, the weather forecast for the day/night, and whether or not it is safe to open the window (or cool enough). The program is continuously being updated and is never expected to be fully finished.
